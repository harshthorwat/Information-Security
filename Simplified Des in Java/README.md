For Running S-DES use following instructions.

1. Open Terminal in the folder containing program files. (all files must be in same folder).

2. For Encryption:
  
  Compile Using:
    
      javac MainEnc.java
      
  Run Using:
      
      java MainEnc
    
3. Enter 10 bit key as input eg. (1010000010) and 8 bit plain text eg. (11100011).

4. You will get 8 bit ciphertext as output.

5. For Decription:

  Compile using:
      
      javac Decryption.java
      
  Run Using:
    
      java Decryption
      
6. Give 10 bit key same as used in encryption and 8 bit ciphertext as input.

7. You will get 8 bit plain text.

        gcc -o enc CeaserCipher.c
  
  Run Using:            
      
        ./enc
  
Enter a plain text and key (Key is integer from 1 to 9).
    
3.You will get the Cipher Text as output.


4.For Decryption use following commands.

  compile using:        
  
      gcc -o dec CeaserCipherDec.c
  
  run using:            
  
      ./dec

Enter ciphertext generated by Encryption algorithm and key same as entered in Encryption algorithm.

5.you will get plain text as output.
